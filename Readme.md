## My process

- UI Design in AdobeXD
- Create the frontend
- Add Magic i.e., JavaScript
- DataBase for Menu Addition
- Store Sales in DataBase

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- Desktop-workflow
- IndexedDB
- JavaScript [Imperative Programming]
- LocalStorage & SessionStorage
- NW.js

#### NW.js

NW.js (previously known as node-webkit) lets you call all Node.js modules directly from DOM and enables a new way of writing applications with all Web technologies.
Using this library, I easily implemented the Silent printing feature.
Link is mentioned in the useful resources section.

### What I learned

I learned alot of things but the most important thing which i learned is understanding the need of framework/library.
To tackle a single button, one has to imperative coding handling all the situtations.
I also learned about IndexedDB which is alot more poweful than LocalStorage.
